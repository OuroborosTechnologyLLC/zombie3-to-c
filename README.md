# README
Port of the old Zombie3 game found on John Gilbertson's website
[here](https://hardcorepawn.com/zombie3/). Source included (`source.pde`) in
case that site goes down.

## Controls

- `Z` -- Reset scene
- `Left Click` -- Blasts area under mouse position
- `W S A D` -- Moves camera
- `Mouse Wheel` -- Zooms camera in and out

## Differences from original
I have made changes, such as camera controls and the "highlight" effects when
zombies are spawned and when humans panic, and when a blast occurs. These, I
believe, do not hinder or change gameplay beyond convienence. If you disagree,
the source is GPL3, so change it away!

## Attribution
Thanks Kevan Davis who made the original program, and John Gilbertson who
modified it and posted it online, where I played it as a child. Their code
belongs to them, I simply reimplemnted the code into the `C` Programming
Language.
